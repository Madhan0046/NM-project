# ⚡ AI Energy Efficiency Optimization

This project applies Machine Learning to predict and optimize the **Heating Load (HL)** and **Cooling Load (CL)** of buildings based on architectural and environmental parameters. It uses the Energy Efficiency dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
🔗 [Download ENB2012 Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00242/ENB2012_data.xlsx)

The dataset contains 768 samples and 10 attributes:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| X1 | Relative Compactness |
| X2 | Surface Area |
| X3 | Wall Area |
| X4 | Roof Area |
| X5 | Overall Height |
| X6 | Orientation |
| X7 | Glazing Area |
| X8 | Glazing Area Distribution |
| Y1 | **Heating Load** (target) |
| Y2 | **Cooling Load** (target) |

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Predict Heating Load (Y1) and Cooling Load (Y2)
- Identify optimal building designs to reduce energy usage
- Compare model performance with different ML algorithms

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-energy-efficiency.git
cd ai-energy-efficiency
````

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 4. Predict for a New Sample

```bash
python predict.py --input sample.json
```

---

## 📈 Model Used

* 📦 `RandomForestRegressor`
* Input features are scaled using `StandardScaler`
* Output: Regression predictions for Heating and Cooling Load

---

## 🖼️ Visualization

Model accuracy is evaluated using R² Score and MSE.
Predicted vs. Actual values are plotted for both targets.
